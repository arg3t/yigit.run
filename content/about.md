#### $ whoami

I am a senior student in Ted Ankara College Foundation High School. I dabble in
different areas of computer science every now and then and try to learn new stuff
along the way. I love creating software for my personal use and for people around
me. My favourite languages are Java and C, and I love self-hosting.
